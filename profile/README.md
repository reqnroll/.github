# Reqnroll

Reqnroll is an open-source .NET test automation tool to practice [Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/).

Reqnroll is a .NET port of [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) and it is based on the [SpecFlow](https://www.specflow.org/) framework and code base. You can find more information about the goal of the Reqnroll project and the motivations to create it on the [Reqnroll website](https://reqnroll.net/).

Reqnroll enables writing executable specifications for BDD using [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/), the widely-accepted *feature file* specification format. With that you can define the requirements using *Given-When-Then* style *scenarios* and turn them to automated tests in order to verify their implementation.

Reqnroll works on all major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), on all commonly used .NET implementations (including .NET Framework 4.6.2+ and .NET 8.0). For executing the automated scenarios, Reqnroll can use [MsTest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-mstest), [NUnit](https://nunit.org/) or [xUnit](https://xunit.net/). On Reqnroll projects you can work using Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code and Rider, but you can also use Reqnroll without any IDE.
